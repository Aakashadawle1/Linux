# Linux

He decided to create personal project when he was in student of University of Helsinki his name is Linus Torvalds.
In the bigining of 1991 he preferred the much more powerful and stable UNIX operating system but he didn't find a basic system within the 5000 USD thats why he obtained the MINIX, which is small part of UNIX that was created in 1987 by Andrew Tanenbaum in the Netherlands to teach UNIX to university students. MINIX still had a some drowbacks. Linus started to overcome and this problem himself of MINIX. There ware first step to create Linux. Linus developed the terminal program and it was sufficient for his needs after he was think to nice about the transfering and saving files and this was the step to born Linux. Devlopement was done on MINIX using GNU C compiler.

In August, 1991, Linus announced that he was working on this operating system in a Usenet newsgroup of Minix users:
**_Hello everybody out there using minix_ -**

**_I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them._**

On Spe 1991, Linus competed the crud version (0.01) of his new operating system.
On Oct 1991, he Annaunced first official version (0.02) and it support to both bash (Unix-like operating systems and the GNU C Compiler.

Linus was decided to release Linux under the GPL(GNU General public licence). They make the source code freely available for any modified versions that they create and it came as a open source software. Linux Distribut and support to X-Window system, GNOME and KDE desktop environment also a most popular HTTP server. Linux support some application like Mozila Firefox, Office application, GIMP Image editor

Some Linux base operating systems are:

There are so many flavors of Linux
1. Red Hat - 
Red Hat started out as the "little Linux". Its Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is maintain and support.
 1. SUSE - 
The Micro Focus-owned (but independently operated) SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) is stable, easy to maintain and offers 24x7 support.
 3. CentOS - 
CentOS will remain free, with support provided by the community-led CentOS project rather than through Red Hat.
 4. Debian - 
If you're confused by Debian's inclusion here, don't be. Debian doesn't have a commercial support but you can connect with Debian-savvy consultants around the world via their Consultants page.
 5. Slackware - 
While not generally associated with commercial distributions, Slackware Linux Slackware maintains relationships with several companies that provide fee-based support. Support provided company name are Adjuvo Consulting Ltd, Multi-User Solutions, RedAccess Corporation etc.

Diffrance flavors of Linux

 Ubuntu - 
It is reletevly late arrival and it's based on Debion with included with well known software like firefox, office.
It is use a complex repository as a apt and allows redistribution of binary packages via Personal Package Archives.

 Debian - 
 Arch provides more expedient support for building custom, installable packages from outside sources, with a ports-like package build system. Debian does not offer a ports system, relying instead on its large binary repositories.
 Debian has a more vehement stance on free software but still includes non-free software in its non-free repos. Arch is more lenient, and therefore inclusive, concerning non-free packages as defined by GNU.
 
 Slackware - 
Slackware uses BSD-style init scripts, whereas Arch uses systemd.
Arch supplies a package management system in pacman which, unlike Slackware's standard tools, offers automatic dependency resolution and allows for more automated system upgrades. Slackware users typically prefer their method of manual dependency resolution, citing the level of system control it grants them, as well as Slackware's excellent supply of pre-installed libraries and dependencies. Arch is a rolling-release system. Slackware is seen as more conservative in its release cycle, preferring proven stable packages. Arch is more bleeding-edge in this respect.

Fedora - 
Fedora offers many installation options including a graphical installer as well as a minimal option. Fedora "spins" also provide alternative assortments of desktop environments to choose from, each with a modest assortment of default packages. Arch, on the other hand, only provides a few scripts meant to ease the process of a minimal base system install.
