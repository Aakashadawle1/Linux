# Linux

> ## 1) Who created Linux?
He is a born 28-dec-1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He is a son of Niles and Anna Torvalds.
When he was 21 year old student University of Helsinki.
He decided to create personal project his name is Linus Torvalds.
Linux is a free operating system which is created on 25-Aug-1991.

> ## 2) What is “open source”?
Open source is a software or a program. It is free to access the normal user to use or developer can do modification in
a source code. Open source software is developed as a public colabreation. It made for freely available.
  
  Open source software are
  * Mozilla's firefox
  * Thunderburd email client
  * Apache HTTP web server
  * Database system
  
  Also a Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn release software as Open Source, so developers can share knowledge,
  innovate solutions and contribute to stable.

> ## 3) How is Linux developed and maintained?
In the bigining of 1991 he preferred the much more powerful and stable UNIX operating system but he didn't find a basic system 
within the mannage 5000 USD thats why he obtained the MINIX, which is small part of UNIX that was created in 1987 by Andrew 
Tanenbaum in the Netherlands to teach UNIX to university students. MINIX still had a some drowbacks. Linus started to overcome 
this problem himself of MINIX. There ware a first step  to creating a Linux. Linus quickly developed the terminal program 
and it was sufficient for his needs after he was think to nice about the transfering and saving files and this was the step to
born Linux. Linus wanted to name his creation Freax. Combination of Freax was 'free' and 'x' ('x' taked from name of UNIX) but 
in a 1991 when uploaded the file on FPT server by his friend Ari Lemmke. He is Administrator of FTP server, thinkking that 
"Freax" was not good name, decided to name it "Linux" on the server without consulting Linus. After Linus consented to "Linux".
In Aug, 1991, Linus announced working on new operating system which is called "Linux". "The Linux Foundatation" is maintain 
the Linux kernel. This foundation was found in a 2000, it is the open source comunity.

> ## 4) Why are there so many flavors?
Linux it just a kernel. Kernel use to communucate between the user and machine. Linux kenrnel is a open-source, thats
why any body can build there own OS and release them (They have to release it under the GPL v2 Lincence). This mean anyone
can modify it to solve the problem which is the important. So insted of having the control over what user can do with 
linux, it was decided to user will have fill control on OS thats why so many flavors are present. If you want to devloped
your own OS [see]([http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html) or ask very huge linux devloper to do for you.

Ubuntu - 
It is reletevly late arrival and it's based on Debion with included with well known software like firefox, office.
