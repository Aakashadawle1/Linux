# Linux

He decided to create personal project when he was in student of University of Helsinki his name is Linus Torvalds.
In the bigining of 1991 he preferred the much more powerful and stable UNIX operating system but he didn't find a basic system within the 5000 USD thats why he obtained the MINIX, which is small part of UNIX that was created in 1987 by Andrew Tanenbaum in the Netherlands to teach UNIX to university students. MINIX still had a some drowbacks. Linus started to overcome and this problem himself of MINIX. There ware first step to create Linux. Linus developed the terminal program and it was sufficient for his needs after he was think to nice about the transfering and saving files and this was the step to born Linux. Devlopement was done on MINIX using GNU C compiler.

In August, 1991, Linus announced that he was working on this operating system in a Usenet newsgroup of Minix users:
**_Hello everybody out there using minix_ -**

**_I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)_**

On Spe 1991, Linus competed the crud version (0.01) of his new operating system.
On Oct 1991, he Annaunced first official version (0.02) and it support to both bash (Unix-like operating systems and the GNU C Compiler.

Linus was decided to release Linux under the GPL(GNU General public licence). They make the source code freely available for any modified versions that they create and it came as a open source software. Linux Distribut and support to X-Window system, GNOME and KDE desktop environment also a most popular HTTP server. Linux support some application like Mozila Firefox, Office application, GIMP Image editor
