# Linux

> ## 1) Who created Linux?
He is a born 28-dec-1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He is a son of Niles and Anna Torvalds.
When he was 21 year old student University of Helsinki.
He decided to create personal project his name is Linus Torvalds.
Linux is a free operating system which is created on 25-Aug-1991.

> ## 2) What is “open source”?
Open source is a software or a program. It is free to access the normal user to use or developer can do modification in
a source code. Open source software is developed as a public colabreation. It made for freely available.
  
  Open source software are
  * Mozilla's firefox
  * Thunderburd email client
  * Apache HTTP web server
  * Database system
  
  Also a Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn release software as Open Source, so developers can share knowledge,
  innovate solutions and contribute to stable.

> ## 3) How is Linux developed and maintained?
In the bigining of 1991 he preferred the much more powerful and stable UNIX operating system but he didn't find a basic system 
within the mannage 5000 USD thats why he obtained the MINIX, which is small part of UNIX that was created in 1987 by Andrew 
Tanenbaum in the Netherlands to teach UNIX to university students. MINIX still had a some drowbacks. Linus started to overcome 
this problem himself of MINIX. There ware a first step  to creating a Linux. Linus quickly developed the terminal program 
and it was sufficient for his needs after he was think to nice about the transfering and saving files and this was the step to
born Linux. Linus wanted to name his creation Freax. Combination of Freax was 'free' and 'x' ('x' taked from name of UNIX) but 
in a 1991 when uploaded the file on FPT server by his friend Ari Lemmke. He is Administrator of FTP server, thinkking that 
"Freax" was not good name, decided to name it "Linux" on the server without consulting Linus. After Linus consented to "Linux".
In Aug, 1991, Linus announced working on new operating system which is called "Linux". "The Linux Foundatation" is maintain 
the Linux kernel. This foundation was found in a 2000, it is the open source comunity.

> ## 4) Why are there so many flavors?
Linux it just a kernel. Kernel use to communucate between the user and machine. Linux kenrnel is a open-source, thats
why any body can build there own OS and release them (They have to release it under the GPL v2 Lincence). This mean anyone
can modify it to solve the problem which is the important. So insted of having the control over what user can do with 
linux, it was decided to user will have fill control on OS thats why so many flavors are present. If you want to devloped
your own OS [see]([http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/index.html) or ask very huge linux devloper to do for you.

> ## 5) Who maintains each flavor?

> ## 6) What is the difference between each flavor?
Ubuntu - 
It is reletevly late arrival and it's based on Debion with included with well known software like firefox, office.
It is use a complex repository as a apt and allows redistribution of binary packages via Personal Package Archives.

Debian - 
Arch provides more expedient support for building custom, installable packages from outside sources, with a ports-like package build system. Debian does not offer a ports system, relying instead on its large binary repositories.
Debian has a more vehement stance on free software but still includes non-free software in its non-free repos. Arch is more lenient, and therefore inclusive, concerning non-free packages as defined by GNU.

Slackware - 
Slackware uses BSD-style init scripts, whereas Arch uses systemd.
Arch supplies a package management system in pacman which, unlike Slackware's standard tools, offers automatic dependency resolution and allows for more automated system upgrades. Slackware users typically prefer their method of manual dependency resolution, citing the level of system control it grants them, as well as Slackware's excellent supply of pre-installed libraries and dependencies.
Arch is a rolling-release system. Slackware is seen as more conservative in its release cycle, preferring proven stable packages. Arch is more bleeding-edge in this respect.

Fedora - 
Fedora offers many installation options including a graphical installer as well as a minimal option. Fedora "spins" also provide alternative assortments of desktop environments to choose from, each with a modest assortment of default packages. Arch, on the other hand, only provides a few scripts meant to ease the process of a minimal base system install.
